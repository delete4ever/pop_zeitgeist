2 ContributorsBenz Truck! Lyrics
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Walk in the bank and i cash me a check for a M (Cash me a check for a M)
I've been that guy, tryna tell these niggas I'm him (Nigga I'm him)
Praying to god tryna free my body of sin (Freeing my body of sin)
Its so many thots, but I'm just focused on the guap
Yeah Yeah

Had to get my bands up (bands up)
Now I'm hopping out the Benz truck (Benz truck)
Bad lil bitch a dancer
She a leg she stand up
Trap out with my niggas
Had to get my bands up (bands up)
Now I'm hopping out the Benz truck (Benz truck)
Bad lil bitch a dancer
She a leg she stand up
Trap out with my niggas

You say that you love me that's not how you feel
We break up for a week and all of a sudden you got a new male
This shit don't feel real
Shit is surreal
You say its a new fling
This can't be a new thing
Do you think I'm stupid?
Bitch are you stupid?
CeeLo green shit
I'm tryna forget you
Counting all these bands, but they don't fix my issues
I hate you, but i miss you

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Had to get my bands up (bands up)
Now I'm hopping out the Benz truck (Benz truck)
Bad lil bitch a dancer
She a leg she stand up
Trap out with my niggas
Had to get my bands up (bands up)
Now I'm hopping out the Benz truck (Benz truck)
Bad lil bitch a dancer
She a leg she stand up
Trap out with my niggas

Hop up out a Benz truck
I was down but I ain't give up
Now when niggas call my name I ring up
My bitch look like a princess in my kingdom
Running up racks got my foot on the gas
You fuck with my guap, put my foot in yo ass
This Glock like a rocket, i let that bitch blast
I'm the grumpy old troll, I can't let that bitch pass
Feel like Future and Drake gotta digital dash
I'm making history, you can't get rid of me
I'm sipping wock it got straight to my kidneys
These niggas killing me
They like my kids to me
Smoking that haze its all in my eyes
I swear its gon fuck up my view
I can't accept that I'm wrong
So when I fuck up imma blame it on you
When imp alone in my mind I tend to find
I don't know what to do
I just been feeling confused
Feel caged like i live in a zoo

Had to get my bands up (bands up)
Now I'm hopping out the Benz truck (Benz truck)
Bad lil bitch a dancer
She a leg she stand up
Trap out with my niggas
Had to get my bands up (bands up)
Now I'm hopping out the Benz truck (Benz truck)
Bad lil bitch a dancer
She a leg she stand up
Trap out with my niggasEmbed
