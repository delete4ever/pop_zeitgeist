She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, "Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer," she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark

Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back

Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened

With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though

If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up

Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

Going through frustration
Κινειται ειναι αναμεσα στον εκνευρισμο
Clean Bandit, Sean-da-Paul, Anne-Marie
Καθαριζει τους ληστες,....
Sing, make them hear
Τραγουδαει, τους κανει να την ακουνε

She works at nights by the water
Αυτη εργαζεται τις νυχτες όπως το νερο
She's gone astray so far away
Αυτη εξαφανιζεται περιπλανωμενη τοσο μακρυα
From my father's daughter
Απο την κορη του πατερα μου
She just wants a life for her baby
Αυτη το μονο που θελει ειναι μια νεα ζωη για το μωρο της
All on her own, no one will come
Ολα ειναι δικα της, κανενας δεν θα ρθει
She's got to save him
Αυτη εχει ως σκοπο να τον σωσει

I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?

I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

Salaam alaikum I'm marring the walls I spray
Flicking this zoot but I miss the damn ashtray
Gassin' me gassin' you these bars are on the airway
Happiest memories at other fuckers' birthdays
Don't know what I feel I treat like child's play
Don't like myself but I fly like I'm a blue jay
Wish you would call me by your name like Chalamet
This life don't matter and I ain't tryna downplay
These are just bars it's not a fuckin' essay
Everyday wishin' that I would fade away
Smoke that gas I'm packin' but I'm not from Green Bay
Dead inside but I still cheese and smile everyday
It's a good life this ain't no doomsday
Yet at least
We got some time to get our shit together
In the meantime I let my soul weather
Floating through life like I'm a feather

Never knew I would feel fine
But I always felt one day I'd shine
Gotta wait until the stars align
Stop playing with me
Not sure how to feel
And I'm too drunk to see
It's my mind you always steal
What's even real, oh, what's even there?
I'm not sure but I want more

Ayo holy shit bro that was so fucking *laughs*
Ayo deadass dude my fucking nipples are hard now dawg shit

Riding my in mama's Honda you know I'm okay
Making songs with the homies you know we don't play
But sometimes i feel down
Ridin' around town
Get to your place and it's better then my own
I only want you like a dog without a bone
But yesterday I didn't know
You are the only one to make me whole, yuh
Bouncin' on my flow
You know how it go
Got all the girls looking at my toes
Even tho they look like ass
But they still ride the boat
When I smoke that gas
I feel like i'm afloat
On some clouds with my girl
Wearin' her sweatshirt like i'm earl
You can't fuck with my drip
Like a faucet failing
All I wanna do is kiss your lips
Navigate your body like I'm sailing
We don't do any work in this room
We're like Lebron sweepin' with a broom
This is slight work yuh
Hall of fame like I'm Dirk
Never knew I would feel fine
But I always felt one day I'd shine
Gotta wait until the stars align

La vida es como la espuma por eso hay que darse como el marEmbed Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol' up, lil’, hol’ up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (Hol’ up, bitch)

Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still I take you down right on your mama couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all
