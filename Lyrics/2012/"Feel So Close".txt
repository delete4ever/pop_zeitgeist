I feel so close to you right now, it's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve like a big deal
Your love pours down on me, surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now



I feel so close to you right now, it's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve like a big deal
Your love pours down on me, surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now


And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now
