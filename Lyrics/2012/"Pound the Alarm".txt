Oh, oh, oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we gettin' hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down (Uh)

Yo, what I gotta do to show these girls that I own 'em?
Some call me Nicki and some call me Roman
Skeeza, please, I'm in Ibiza, woah
Giuseppe Zanotti, my own sneaker
Sexy, sexy, that’s all I do
If you need a bad bitch, let me call a few
Pumps on and them little mini-skirts is out
I see some good girls, I'ma turn 'em out
Okay, bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, eh?
Bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, let's go

Music makes me high

Oh, oh, oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we gettin' hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down
Pound the alarm

Music makes me high

Oh, oh, oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we gettin' hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down
