Havana Brown!
(We run the night)
RedOne!
Mr. Worldwide
(We run, yes, we run the night)
From Miami, Morocco, to Australia
To the world, Dale! (Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!)

When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy, are you afraid of the dark, dark?
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me, do you know where it starts, start?
And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel apart, ahhh
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound
Well, the sound is the key to my heart, heart

We run, yes, we run the night, ni-night, night
Wе run, yes, we run the night
Wе, we, we run, we, we, we run, run
We run, yes, we run the night, the night
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!

We party people, we party hard
Life is short, so live it large
Turn up your speakers, so we can be
Dancin' free, free

You can find us in the club
With our hands up in the air
Showin' everybody love
Live it up like we don't care
Everybody say
Eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh
Eh eh, eh eh eh eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh
Eh eh, eh eh eh eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Get it!

Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run, run
We run, yes, we run the night, ni-night, night
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!1Embed
