11 ContributorsHow Do You Like Me Now?! Lyrics
Hey, I was always the crazy one, broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the fifty-yard line
You were always the perfect one and a valedictorian so
Under your number, I wrote "call for a good time"
I only wanted to get your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides, you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud
How do you like me now?

How do you like me now, now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me, but I always dreamed about
Livin' in your radio, how do you like me now?

When I took off to Tennessee, I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money, girl, ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home and you're always alone
And your kids hear you cry down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringing, who could that be singin'?
It's me, baby, with your wake-up call
How do you like me now?
You might also like
How do you like me now, now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me, but I always dreamed about
Livin' in your radio, how do you like me now? Yeah


How do you like me now, now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me, but I always dreamed about
Livin' in your radio, how do you like me now?

Tell me, baby
I will preach on3Embed
