Woah-ooh, let me tell you, girl
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh
Hey, here I go, here I go

I know you heard men say it time and time again
That they would rock your world and change your life
But I can't blame them 'cause you make a nigga wanna get involved, wanna get them drawers (Woo)
Well, I'm gon' put my bid in to get at you
No disrespect but I want it bad as they do
The only difference is they look out for themselves
But I'm doin' it, just to hear you yell, yeah

Oh (Oh)
That's gonna be the sound, girl, when it's goin' down
Your body sayin', "Oh" (Oh-oh)
Don't have to say my name, girl, I'm just glad you came
So you can say, "Oh", in the mornin', "Oh", in the night
You sayin', "Oh" means, I was hittin' it right
Oh-ooh, woah-ooh, woah-ooh
You can't be mad at me, I'm just aimin' to please, let me hear you scream, "Oh"

Girl come on over and let's get this thing crackin'
Youâ€™ll be surprised when you see what O's I'm packin'
'Cause I'm young but I'm ready, tryna get hot and heavy
Turn you out if you let me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, I'm gon' take you somewhere that you never been
Show you some things that'll make you wanna show your friends
Have you so weak that you can't even say a thing
But that's okay, all you gotta say

But trust me, baby girl, O is where you wanna be (Wanna be)
'Cause believe me when I tell you, I'm not tryna tell you what to do (What to do)
'Cause when it's said and done the choice ain't mine, it's really up to you (So just)
Just say, "Yes" (Say, "Yes"), don't fix your mouth to tell me, "No" (Drop it, drop it)

Let me hear you say, "Oh" when you come from the back to the front (Say, "Oh")
Now somebody say my name
Let me hear you say, "Oh" when the sun goin' down
Let me hear you say, "Oh" when you can't make another sound (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
