Compa, ¿qué le parece esa morra?
La que anda bailando sola me gusta pa' mí
¡Bella! Ella sabe que está buena
Que todos andan mirándola cómo baila
Me acerco y le tiro todo un verbo
Tomamos tragos sin peros, solo tentación
Le dije: "Voy a conquistar tu familia, que en unos días vas a ser mía"
Me dijo que estoy muy loco, pero le gusta
Que ningún vato como yo actúa

Y ahí te va, mija
Y pura Doble P, viejo
Así nomás, compa Pedro
Puro Eslabon Armado
Pa' las plebitas
¡Cha-chau!

No soy un vato que tiene varo
Pero hablando del corazón, te cumplo todo
Me agarró, pegadito dе su mano
Mi compa ni se la creyó, que al pasar fui yo
Su cuеrpo, juro por Dios, que era tan perfecta
Su cinturita como modelo
Sus ojos desde el principio me enamoraron
A ella le gusto y a mí me gustaYou might also likeEmbed

Barranquilla, Medallo5Embed I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happenеd to her
I didn't load her down with questions

I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And asked her where he was

'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind

And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, "Somebody's gotta take care of him"
So I quit school and that's what I did

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Thought maybe together you and me would find it

Take your fast car and keep on driving

Время игры в гольф в без четверти шесть

Услышал твою новую хуйню, это смущает, дерьмо

Я буду ждать тебя, ждать тебя
Ранним утром или поздней ночью (Я буду ждать тебя)
Время не имеет значения (Я буду ждать тебя)

Как только я нахожу время, все в порядке (Эй)
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob

Ты молишься за моих демонов, детка, я тебя понял
Каждый раз, когда я пью лин, я становлюсь уязвимым
Я знаю звуки грома, когда он приходит
Она понимает, я не могу брать ее туда, куда иду
Я был в поле, как дети кукурузы

Я могу слышать твои слезы, когда они падают на телефон
Злишься на себя, потому что не можешь оставить меня в покое
Сплетни, грязь, это не то, что мы делаем (Мир был окончен)
Путешествую по миру (Ты будешь плакать или попытаешься добраться до меня?)
На телефон капают слезы (Скажи мне сейчас, я хочу, чтобы ты ясно выразился, да)
Становлюсь уязвимым, когда принимаю таблетки (Скажи мне сейчас, мне нужно, чтобы ты ясно выразился, да)
Когда ты пьяна, скажи мне, что ты чувствуешь (Я буду ждать тебя, ждать тебя)
Когда я пьян, я вижу реальность (Я буду ждать тебя, я буду ждать тебя)
Пожалуйста, скажи, что это (Я буду ждать, буду ждать тебя, тебя )
Не говоришь это, потому что знаешь, что я хочу услышать (Я буду ждать тебя, я буду ждать тебя)

Заставляешь ходить по планке, знаешь, что я пловец (Я буду ждать тебя)
Должен был стать твоим псом, но ты посадила в будку
Детка, закрой намордником, весь этот лай за ужином
Я издевался над тобой, когда у тебя был крошечный президент
Ты стала лучше, когда встретила меня, и это не совпадение
Пытался выбить из тебя самое лучшее, наверное, я не настолько влиятелен
Думаю, я не тот, кто предназначен для тебя

Porque duermo mejor si sueño que estás aquí
Si supieras que te escribí
No he mandado los mensajes, siguen todos ahí
Wow, qué mucho me ha costa'o
Quizás te hice un favor cuando me fui de tu lado
Borracho viendo tus fotos, me duele ver que tú sí has mejorado
No tienes días grises, ya no te duelen las cicatrices
Y yo pensando si decirte que

Me queda 1%

Que si me ven con otra en una disco solo es perdiendo el tiempo
Baby, ¿pa' qué te miento?
Eso de que me vieron feliz, no, no es cierto (Ey)

불꺼진 romantic all my life
내 주위는 온통 lovely day
내 눈 속에 비친 arrow sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
그만 힐끗대고 말해줘요 hold me (Hold me)
다시 crying in my room
숨기고 싶어 (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb

또 꿈길을 걷는 every day
눈 뜨면 다시 또 flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
나 솔직히 지금이 편해
상상만큼 짜릿한 걸까?

Now I'm so lonely (Lonely)
매일 꿈속에서 연습했죠 kiss me (Kiss me)
다시 crying in my room
포기할까봐 (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb

I'm so lonely, hold me tightly
짜릿한 걸 원해 who will really love me truly
내게 기다림은 없어 I can't wait
더는 믿지 않아 now I'm gonna make it mine
Love is a light, I'ma show my love is right
It's not a joke, so give it to me right now
No more chance to you
You know, hey, d-d-d-dumb boy

꿈속에 매일 밤
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool
A fool for love, a fool for love
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid (Hopeless girl is seeking)
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid (Someone who will share this feeling)
다시 한번 못 들은 척 기회를 줄게 (I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb (A fool for love, a fool for love)Embed (Happy Christmas)
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
"Happy Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you," I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Who give me something in return
(I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone)
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day?
I thought you were someone special
I gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
You gave it away
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone
