We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried

And come get all of this love"

She already said if I don't come on time, she—
Might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (Ah-ah-ah)
And then ask me kindly— (Ah-ah-ah)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And then, we always wake up singing the same song

I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

And I thought you were innocent

I'm wide awake

(I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard with an open heart
(I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong?
(I'm wide awake)
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see ain't always what it seems
(I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

I wish I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

Fallin' from cloud nine
Crashin' from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm fallin' from cloud nine

Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece and landed on my feet
(I'm wide awake)
Need nothing to complete myself, no
(I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den, I don't have to pretend
(And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end

I wish I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

Fallin' from cloud nine (It was outta the blue, I'm)
Crashin' from the high
I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm fallin' from cloud nine

(I'm wide awake)
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am tryin' to hold on
(I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

Yeah, I'm fallin' from cloud nine (It was outta the blue, I'm)
Crashin' from the high
You know I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)

How to be brave? How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Show me how you do
I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh
I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping
Music, I might lose it
Blast to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)
I don't care the night, she don't care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jump and don't stop
Surfing the crowd ooh said I gotta be the man
When they heading my van, mic check one two
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto
Club shuts down, a hundred super models
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh
Party rocker, fa-show stopper, more shampoo
Number one, club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars, so cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off til I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Oh, it's on like everything goes, round up baby til the freaky show
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, private show
I like em untamed, don't tell me hide pain
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, coming harder when we hit fame
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh
I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and lets begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body dominate you til you had 'nough
I hear you like the wild stuff
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones wild ones) ooh
I am a wild one break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one tame me now
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowlYou might also likeEmbed
