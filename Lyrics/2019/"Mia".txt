Bad Bunny, baby, baby-baby
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
Yeah

You have every guy's attention
But you are ready for me
Making them hate me more
Because they all want to taste you
What they don’t know is that you don't go around with anyone
And they all want to taste you
What they don't know is that I’m going to look for you tonight

Tell him you're mine, mine
You know you're mine, mine
You've said it yourself
When we were doing it
Tell him you're mine, mine
You know you're mine, mine
You've said it yourself
When we were doing it
(yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

Baby, I'm a fanatic for the way you walk
I give you my everything, even my breath
With you I see everything in spiral
I want to take photos of us and make them go viral
Your eyes make me focus like Adderall
With you, I pull up my overalls
I touch you and the world stops spinning
Not even death is going to separate us
Baby, I’m only yours
Tell him you’re coming with me
They should stop complimenting you
That no one's gonna touch you
You might also like
Tell him you’re mine, mine
You know you're mine, mine
You've said it yourself
When we were doing it
Tell him you're mine, mine
You know you’re mine, mine
You've said it yourself
When we were doing it

I'm your Romeo, but I'm not a saint
I would scare these idiots with the .40
They want me ever since I sing
But I'm only yours
I'm your Romeo, but I'm not a saint
I would scare these idiots with the .40
They want me ever since I sing
But I'm only yours
Tell him you are mine since high school
Your mom's favorite son-in-law
The guy that had all the Jordans and the Nikes
Tell these stupid guys to stop giving you likes
I want this whole night
To remember those times in the stairs
Tell him I'm not just some guy
I am your first, you are my first
Because they all want to taste you
What they don't know is that you don't just go with anyone
And they all want to taste you
What they don't know is that I'm going to look for you tonight

Tell him you're mine, mine
You know you're mine, mine
You've said it yourself
When we were doing it
Tell him you're mine, mine
You know you're mine, mine
You've said it yourself
When we were doing it1Embed
