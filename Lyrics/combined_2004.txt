But all you got to do is keep it real wit a player
Just answer your phone whenever I call
Cause I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball
I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they wanna roll cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile
I need a lady on the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook cause a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you

I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane
Far away (I will)
And break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun (Into the sun)
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Break away
Break away18Embed I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning

I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with every day
And all the pain I put you through

I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

And the reason is you
I've found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you52Embed Hit me!

Ooh, I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like ya don't know what to do
After I had done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Move so fast, baby, now I can't find you
Ooh, I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk, but it seems like you can't come through
All them nights like you could satisfy me
Now I see where believin' you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me

Ooh, two things I don't like when I tryin' to get my groove
Is a partner that meets me only halfway and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Do you understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you?
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference from a man and an adolescent
It ain't you, boo, so get to steppin'

Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath, ha, ha (Ooh)
If you can't make me say, "Ooh"

Why you ask for some?
You ain't really want none
If you can't make me say "Ooh" (Ooh, ooh)
Like the beat of this groove
You don't have no business in this
Here's your papers, baby, you are dismissed (Woo)

Come on

I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't wanna get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom

And there's just too much that time cannot erase

When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
And now I'm bound by the life you left behind

Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

I hope this letter catches up with you and finds you well
It's been dry but they're callin' for rain
And everything's the same ol'-same in Johnsonville
Your stubborn ol' daddy ain't said too much
But I'm sure you know he sends his love
And she goes on, in a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh like there's something funny
'Bout the way I talk, when mama sends her best y'all
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

My dearest love, it's almost dawn
I've been layin' here all night long
Wonderin' where you might be
I saw your mama and I showed her the ring

As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been

Someday I'm going to run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons

I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'Cause I'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know
That I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead
Singer of my band

So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
"Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby"
They're all like, "Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock"
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me

Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
