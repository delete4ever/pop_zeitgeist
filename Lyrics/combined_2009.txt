I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

'Cause all I see are stilettos

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick

Were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers and
Swapping I don't cares

Talking politics
Blonde and red-haired chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

He said "I fought two wars
Been married and divorced"
What brings you to Ohio?
He said "Damned if I know"

He lit a cigarette
Said "These damn things will kill me yet"

But God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

Last call is 2 a.m
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again

Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire-y
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh, but me
I'm doing well

And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
I left a six-pack
Right there on his grave
And I said

Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

The coldest story ever told

Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies

Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world

He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
(What if, what if?)

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have?
(What if, what if?)
If today was your last day
(What if, what if?)
(If today was your last day)

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

And now I think that I've got it all down
And as I say it louder, I love how it sounds
'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrappin' this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise

It came out like a river, once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
Held onto it forever, just pushing it down
It felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul left to save
Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"

Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (As hard as I did, yeah)

She put her body on me
And she keeps staring me right in my eyes
No tellin' what I'm gon' do
Baby I would rather show you
What you been missin' in your li-i-i-ife
When I get insi-i-i-ide

Girl what you drinkin'? Gon' let it sink in
Here for the weekend, thinkin' we can
See where we could be if we press fast forward
Just one more round, if you’re down, I'm pourin'
Fill another cup up, feelin' on your butt, what
You don't even care now, I was unaware how
Fine you was before my buzz set in

So I made her say "ah, ah-ah"
Now she got her hand on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride (All wet in my ride)
All over my ride (All over my ride)

If you lookin' like a model, when them broke fellas holla

I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong

Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See, I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?

That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

Mmm, she's starin' at me
I'm sittin' wonderin' what she's thinking
Mmm, nobody's talkin'
'Cause talkin' just turns into screamin', oh
And now as I'm yellin' over her, she yellin' over me
All that that means is neither of us are listening
And what's even worse, that we don't
Even remember why we're fighting

So both of us are mad for nothing (Fighting for)
Nothing (Crying for)
Nothing (Woah, oh-oh)
But we won't let it go for nothing (Come back for)
Nothing, it should be nothing

Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin' and a-waggin' around
And I just laughed and said, "Y'all, get in"
She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do? Baby, I don't care
We can go to the show or we can stay right here

And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you, it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but, baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Said, "We can fire it up and I can show you around"
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

And her lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
And when she walks in the room, I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile, knock a grown man to his knees

She got whatever it is, it blows me away
She's everything I wanna say to a woman, but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is, I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever wanna stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people ask me what it is, tell 'em I don't know
There's just something 'bout the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife

She got whatever it is, it blows me away
