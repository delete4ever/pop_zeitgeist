Aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye

I'm holdin' on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you say
But I just can't make a sound (Aye, aye, aye)
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late (Aye, aye, aye)
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late (Aye, aye, aye)
Yeah (Aye, aye, aye)

I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you, oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothin' new, yeah, yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turnin' blue, and you say
Sorry, like the angel
Heaven let me think was you, but I'm afraid
You might also like
It's too late to apologize
It's too late (Aye, aye, aye)
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late (Aye, aye, aye)
Woah-ooh-oh

Aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye

It's too late to apologize
It's too late (Aye, aye, aye)
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late (Aye, aye, aye)
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah (Aye, aye, aye)
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah

I'm holdin' on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground44Embed
