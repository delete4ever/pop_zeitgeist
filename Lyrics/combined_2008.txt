If you are what you say you are (Yeah, yeah)
A superstar (Gon' say now)
Then have no fear, the camera's here (Uh)
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh (The return)
If you are what you say you are
A superstar (Uh-huh)
Then have no fear, the crowd is here (Yeah)
And the lights are on (Ha)
And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, yeah (Free Chilly)

Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu'
Tryna cash his microphone check, two-one-two
Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees; "What have you brung? You?
Did you improve on a design? Did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You—the more famous person—you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, come too!"
And then it hit me, standing outside of heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
"Go back, whatever you did, you undo."
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha

If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, yeah

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and (Pew!)
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Uh)
They want everything back (Back) that they've paid
'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, yeah

So, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along, and when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, "You need to go and see that!"
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, "Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha"
"Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha"
If you are what you say you are
A superstar (Star)
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)
If you are
What you say you are
Then have no fear49Embed Please don't stop the music (Music, music, music, music)

Could it be that we have been this way before?
I know you don't think that I am trying
I know you're wearing thin down to the core

But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed, but I have loved you from the start

Oh, but hold your breath

Don't make me change my mind

They be like "Yeah!" when they song come on

It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust

I'm staring down myself, counting up the years

Steady hands, just take the wheel
Every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal
For the life I lead

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare

And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I've seen?

I probably shouldn't say this, but at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standin' in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and silent, as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear (Clear, clear)

I probably should mention the seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy

See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used

And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she ask him: "Where my money at?"

Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes

"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"

Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

And Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel, yeah

My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good, it never made her happy
But I bet that new Mercedes could (My life)
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should (My life)
With the top back
In my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I still keep this motherfucker cocked back

Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same
