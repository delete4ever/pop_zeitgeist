boring uninteresting forgive need get back song drake give fuck bout hater long bitch love song care many people dislike long woman willing sex typical reason song like ineffective defense mechanism cocky confident braggadocio actually listen song without arrogant cool care face music video really listen voice future good kush alcohol got bitch call anything voice indicates way happy life excess mean one song trying make statement empty kind life would perfect usually failing vocal melody excused beat full vigor since every time chorus come beat get muffled muted effect present nearly every friggin song drake since vocalist go happens lifeless delivery stop song dead drake give fuck bout hater long bitch love actually sound convinced legitimately sound like care hater know guy sound like

particular plenty female fan still willing groupie late night booty call mean making bone fact respect point still trying get motivation probably better think know mean talk motivation type woman know woman always wanting spend time lil wayne want time could spend scoff heartless succubus hey maybe bad maybe woman actually respectful sorry woman cage like circus animal let get straight lupe fiasco
