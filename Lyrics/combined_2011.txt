Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler, Wayne
These niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side

Mənə bir həkim lazım, mənə bir həkim çağırın
Mənə bir həkim lazım, məni həyata geri gətirməsi üçün

Bütün dünyaya söylədim, bir gün borcumu geri ödəcəyəm
Bunu kasetdə saxladım, bir gün kaseti yenidən oxuda bilim
Amma bunu söyləyərkən mən belə inanmırdım
Şübhə getdikcə yaxınlaşır
Hər günüm ya qara, ya da boz
Ümid, mənə sadəcə bir zərrəsi lazım
Çünki, kimsə mənim gördüyümü görmür
Musiqimlə söyləməyə çalışdığımda bərbad deyirlər
Onlar mükəmməlin nə olduğunu bilmirlər
Bunu yazarkən ayıq olub-olmadığımı belə bilmirəm
Tək bildiyim şey bu pis günlərimdə yanımda olmağının zərurəti
Mənə dayaq oldun, yeni bir həyat verdin
Bütün bunları sənə borcluyam
Amma niyə mənim gördüyüm kimi görə bilmədiyini anlamıram
Bu içimdən gəldi, sən oğlunu itirdin
İblislər səninlə vuruşur, hər yer qaranlıq
İzn ver işıqları yandırıb hər yeri aydınladım və nə olduğunu görməyinə şərait yaradım
Mənim üçün nə ifadə etdiyini bildiyini sanmıram, həm də heç
Çünki, səninlə mən bir komanda kimi idik, sənin köməkçin idim
Bu lənətə gəlmiş mikrofonu buraxdıqda mənimlə savaşmaq istəyəcəksən
Ya da məni qucaqlayacaqsan, amma seçimlərim çox az
Edə biləcəyim bir şey yoxdur, çünki..

Çünki, eşitdiklərim çox mənasız
Amma ya getdikcə tənbəlləşirsən
Ya da artıq özünə inancın qalmadı
Öz fikirlərini belə canlandıra bilmirsən, elə görünür
Qərar verə bilmirsən, özünü günahlandırırsan
Və hardasa mənim köməyim üçün yalvarırsan da
Sanki mən sənin liderinəmmiş kimi, mənim ağıl müəllimim olmalı idin
Artıq dayana bilmirəm, kim olduğunu xatırla
Mənə inanan sən idin
Halbuki hər kəs məni götürməməli olduğunu söylərkən
Şirkətindəki hər kəs, gəl həqiqətlərdən danışaq
Kariyeranı mənim üçün riskə atan sən idin, bunu ikimiz də bilirik
Kimsə ağ birisi ilə əlləşmək istəmədi
Dre, bu kabinetdə ağlayıram
Həyatımı xilas etdin, indi isə xilas etməsi sırası məndə
Amma sənə əsla borcumu ödəyə bilmərəm, etdiklərin hər şeydən önəmli
Amma inanmaqdan əl çəkmirəm, sən də məndən

Sarı paltarınla gəldin, içəridəki hər kəs lağa qoydu
Sən studioya girənə kimi, mikfrofonu öldür demişdim
Dostlarım oldu, bəziləriylə yola getdik
Amma hamısı getdi, ölənə kimi dost qalacağımızı söyləmişdilər
Bəs indi hansı cəhənnəmdədirlər?
Tam onlara ehtiyacım varkən heç birini görə bilmirəm; tək gördüyüm Slim
Hamınız rədd olun! Yalnız ona ehtiyacım var
Lənətə gəlmiş xainlər
Çətin vəziyyətə düşdüyümüzdə sadəcə izləyib güldünüz
İndi isə Aftermath'ın qəzəbini görəcəksiniz, ibnələr!
Bizi yalnızca işləyərkən görəcəksiniz
Və "Harada idiniz" deyə soruşacaqsınız
Götümün qərarsız yanaqlarını öpün, qurdlar, Eminem'iminkiləri də
Pox kimi beatlər və riyaziyyat
Gic prodüsserlər; Mən geri döndüm, piçlər!
Son bir CD daha və sonrasında əşyalarımı toplayıram

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

Talking 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?

It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

I think we've got a real good shot

So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

When the preacher man said, "Say I do"
I did and you did too
Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Yeah baby I love you a lot
I really think we've got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?Embed 
In a country where freedom is acclaimed on a constant basis, lies the bedrock of hate, slavery, & ardent subjection based on color
America. The land where black people aren't seen as people or respected as humans. Rather treated inferior & handled as beasts from the east & not with ease
Our inputs taken for granted. Our lives taken for granted. Our children's futures doubted, and our minds literally ousted
13% of peoples. Smaller than a small fraction, but bigger than the big picture. A group of people so small with an impact so vast, you'd think we was more than we are. We really are
& We always find a way. From the brutal whip wielding slavery, to segregated buses, We made it all the way. All the way from the fields, to the house. till we claimed our freedom, made it out the house & made our way To the White House
Yeah
See they seek to oppress, but our heads are upheld. I wonder how we manage to last with how they keep killing us, but we won't digress & we won't be repressed, we've shown you before, we can't be oppressed

Over a thousand unarmed black peoples was killed by cops in the year 2015. Minorities killed in majority. My hands are up, I can't breathe, I need love

RAP PRELUDE:
It's Lotta hate. It's a Lotta prejudice. A Lotta bullshit. A lotta racism
You might also likeThe shit We're subjected to, I just can't understand it
I can't, I can't  phantom the thought or ideology of hating a fellow human based off the color of their skin, that shit is a sin. The shit is obscene
& I'm here to shed light on what matters & let y'all know that black lives matter. It's 2017, & we gotta make a change. We want peace

VERSE 1:
It's been way too many years that we've been enslaved. Now It's time to air it out, put it on display. I don spent too many years of witnessing this pain. Now I'm fighting, believing that we make a change. I been losing my mind I'm drowning in my faith. Now I'm hoping that Jesus can make me walk on water. Lord I'm gon need signs you hear us at this hour. & I'm gon need yeezus to help this propaganda
20/20 election it won't even matter. But Dead or alive our opinions gotta matter. I took a peek in my mind, it's Plenty bullets flying through it & I'm way too educated, I can't bullet proof it

Every time we try to make a change, they sabotage us. When we do it anyways they annihilate us. It's the same white folks that claim that all lives matter, but passed laws that made us slaves so we could call em masta

The ones that raped our wives & sold our sons away. Yeah that was years back then, that shit ain't go away. Cos It ain't too long ago they burned out black bodies, whipping, hanging, mutilating niggas just to raise their crops. Now they don't hang us, they locking us away. Yeah they don't lynch us, they shooting us on sight. Kill us more than diseases & cause our loss of life. Yeah it hurts way more to bring the past to light

But it ain't gon change if we don't talk about it. & It won’t go away if we ain't acting on it. I'm eating Black-eyed peas, just asking where's the love? Why they shoot us in the back Just like Walter Scott? Why they take away our freedom, making us insane? Then they label us as thugs for setting cars in flames. Ill take a page up out your book & read it right back. Quit being a bully & give my rights back

INTERLUDE:
You know we've got Single mothers in the ghetto struggling to make a living & raise their kids, and a prejudice motherfucker on a random day pulls the trigger & ends their pride & joy. Tamir rice, Freddie Grey, Rekia Boyd. Darrien hunt was Shot 6 times from behind as he was running away

Michael brown in Ferguson. 2 bullets to the head, shot from behind, 4 in his right arm
Jonathan Ferrell was Shot 12 times at close range; the cop kept shooting while he was on the floor. Yeah that's some crazy shit. I can't relate to it

VERSE 2:
When I heard of Michael Moore I couldn’t take no more. Look at Trayvon Martin that boy was seventeen. All those years can't give his mom back. His daddy's tears can't get his son back. Yet you sold that gun that took his son's life. Hundreds of thousands I'm calling y'all out. Murderous demons, clowns & all that

I wish that i could take this pain & give it all back. Grab a couple whips & whoop on y'all’s backs. Put dem shackles on your feet & locks on y'all’s mouths. Let you can see just how it feels when you just can't breathe & got the weight of evil spirits on your poor heart

Yeah you put us through these things just because we black. Damn mofuckas & still we ain't crack. And I’ve still got love for the white race, but you better call me nigga from a safe place

BRIDGE:
Huh
Shits just sad mehn
Lord help us
It's already sad enough I had to lose a brother to cancer. Already bad enough i have to live with pain & hunger. Why do We have to be subjected to all the extra damnation to fuel this anger. We just need you to realize that our black lives matter
So Stop killing my people
Please. Stop killing my people
Stop killing my fucking people
Arrrrrrgggghhhhhhhhhh (Yells)

OUTRO:
I'm tired of mourning. I'm tired of crying. Tired of bleeding. Please believe that we're about 4, 5 miles away from the crossroads. You make us cross that line & you'll regret it. Killing our innocent babies. Locking up our innocent brothers

Same crime a white person commits & walks free, a black person commits & is locked deep. Deep in the coffers of the system. Correctional facilities, more like subjectional facilities. Designed to detain & maintain slavery under the premise of law & legality, with no immunity, but there'll be mutiny

I guarantee we'll make a stand & make demands for a brave heart's in great hands so make plans for the mayhem
A Brave heart in grey hats led my people in formation on a great March that changed lives and sprung the end of a lawless law of open discrimination in this Nation

We have a dream
We still believe In the King within
I am King
We are Kings
We're not weak
We will not blink
We will not sleep
We will not eat
& Please believe we will not chill
Until we're set free
LET US BREATHE…

Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old

By the time you hear this, I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip "dick," you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause "cock" backwards is still "cock," you pricks!

‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzz and
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known that from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9", but I feel like I’m 6'8"

So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top

But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through

God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool

Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh, this has gotta be the good life

This could really be a good life, good life
I say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me
What there's to complain about
