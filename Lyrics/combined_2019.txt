To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright"

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now

We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal

We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well

Tomei uma ilha, (Yeah) inundou a mansão (Muita água)
Abaixei o teto, mais expansão
Dirija um carro em que você possa ficar (It's lit)
Vejo as vadias cobertas (Nos lençóis)
Eu sou um amante de bundas e peitos (Bunda grande)
Acho que todos nós fizemos um pro outro
Agora que todos os parças estão livres (Yeah, yeah)
E estamos fora nessas ruas (Tudo bem)
Você pode fazer isso, você pode rebolar pra mim?
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)

Em um Hellcat porque eu fui criado no inferno
Homem feito, eu não devo favor pra nenhum mano
Quando você conseguir esse dinheiro, mano, mantenha seu coração
Eu tô deslizando no carro, não precisa de chave pra ligar
Eu levo a arma comigo no BET Awards
Quando seu poço secar, você sabe que precisa de mim pra isso
Quando eu estaciono no Buick, você sabe o que tô fazendo
Se a polícia ficar atrás de mim, eu vou fugir e vazar
Dormindo na paleta me transformou em um selvagem
Eu sou um bebê do projeto, agora moro em Calabasas
Como se eu ainda servisse aos demônios, como se ainda estivesse afirmando
Eu tô bebendo lean, tento manter o equilíbrio
Andando naquela Z-Walk, Dickie's com meus Reeboks
Eu não falo muito, apenas deixo a arma falar
Suas joias mexem na água, diamantes tipo re-rock
Minha mina cavalga no pau como se tivesse numa gangorra
Quando eu entrei na cena, eu tava com uma mira
Quando eu entrei na Beam', eu tava de Celine
Garotinha, você é apenas uma aventura, não é isso que quero dizer
Dinheiro pulando pra fora do meu jeans, igual eu faço o esquema
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)
