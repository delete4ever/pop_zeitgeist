Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
Know the water's sweet, but blood is thicker

Oh, if the sky comes fallin' down, for you
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do

Hey, brother
Do you still believe in one another?
Hey, sister
Do you still believe in love? I wonder

Oh, if the sky comes fallin' down, for you
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do
(Ah)

What if I'm far from home?
Oh, brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh, sister, I will help you out
Oh, if the sky comes fallin' down, for you
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do
You might also like

What if I'm far from home?
Oh, brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh, sister, I will help you out
Oh, if the sky comes fallin' down, for you
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do
