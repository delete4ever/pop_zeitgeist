27 ContributorsPurple Dinosaur Lyrics
Tribe. on the move
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh
They gon' say that I went soft on this one, yeah
Yeah, ayy

My momma love me like a rock my momma love me, yeah
I knew that since I made a room up out her tummy, yeah
I knew that since she put that food inside my tummy, yeah
She taught me how to turn that gloom into a sunny day
She say that love's not just a verb no it's an action verb
But I've been thinkin' that it's linkin' or a passive word
Somethin the world be actin like it's lackin' that's for sure
I've been scratchin' all my nappies tryna see what makes you happy
I've been rappin' for the love and peace but I guess that's absurd
Cause radio be playin' rappers that be trappin' birds
But baby I know why the caged bird sings
'Cause only love can make the type of bells that freedom rings
What that means you and me we got the keys
We could get it started like the Black Eyed Peas and yeah
I say we start right here I'm so sincere
I'd rather lend two ears than tattoo tears

I love you and
And you love me, yeah
That's how it be, yeah
That's how it be, yeah
I love you and
And you love me, yeah
That's how it be, yeah
That's how it be, yeah
You might also like
My momma love me so much that she fed me tofu
She did it so that maybe I would grow to
Be a man that knows you can't have bread alone, ooh
Just like you ain't promised a hit 'cause you got Pro Tools
Sometimes I need a spirit bomb like I was Goku
Or maybe Goten boy I'm bout to go in
You know that hate that you were hoping no one noticed
You need to let that thing go like it was Frozen
Oayk I'm trippin', my friend used to be mad efficient
Decided to love people and he became deficient
At time management but really he started to listen
And everything he thought was gold started not to glisten
So here's my proposition, for those in my position
Let's be the opposition to any hostile livin'
They gon say that I went soft on this one but man
I already counted the cost on this one like

I love you and
And you love me and
That's how it be, yeah
That's how it be, yeah
Say I love you and
And you love me and
That's how it be, yeah
Ayy, ayy
Like that purple dinosaur
He taught me that you love me and I love you that is true
But really I do not feel like that's what it's like no more
I see us linin' up for fightin' like we were the troops
I see excitement over bitin' like we watchin' Tyson
Got people writin' for the rappers that we thought were true
I got the tribe., we holdin' signs that sayin' stop the violence
It's too much silence people dying for our mouths to move
Ooh, if you're rude change your attitude
Politicians they be trippin' I'ma act a fool, yeah yeah
And the saddest news how you deny your brother water when your glass is full, yeah
And He's comin', yeah, He's comin' soon
I could see the love train like it's Chattanoo'
Hey, love got me like Yabba Dabba Doo
If you ain't with it change your plan like your data through

I love you and
And you love me and
That's how it be, yeah
That's how it be, yeah
Say I love you and
And you love me and
That's how it be, yeah
I love you and
And you love me and
That's how it be, Yeah
That's how it be, Yeah
Say I love you and
And you love me and
That's how it be
They gon say that I went soft on this one, yeahEmbed
