2 ContributorsFOAM Lyrics
A la una de la tarde de ese mismo día
Julio y Tenoch emprendieron el regreso
Fue un viaje sin eventualidades y muy silencioso
Sus familias no se enteraron de que su viaje fue a la playa
Ni de la compańía de Luisa
Ella se quedó en San Bernabé para comenzar al día siguiente su exploración por las Bahías de la zona
Al despedirse de Tenoch y Julio, Luisa les dijo:
La vida es como la espuma por eso hay que darse como el mar

Stop playing with me
Not sure how to feel
And I'm too drunk to see
It’s my mind you always steal
What's even real, oh, what's even there
I’m not sure but I want more

I spend too much time on Tiktok yuh
Shake that ass or kick rocks
Rocks like Bedrock
Rocks like red rock
At the Grand Canyon
I would fuck Megan Thee Stallion
She said wet ass pussy, well, like a river
And I got your bitch buyin' me dinner
My stomach is full but I still pull
Pull on the stick while I pull your bitch
I hate being lonely
So I fuck on the homies
You can say I want the whole crew
But your mom, she's a hoe too
How do I know you ask?
Well last night I was tappin' that ass
Let's switch up the flow
Pour me some more
SZA Love Galore
Featuring Travis Scott
Might cop his burger
Baby girl I ain't tryna hurt you
Not even a little bit
But I got problems just like Ari and Iggy said
Too Biggie to be here stressin'
Lemme teach you a lesson
I'll kill you with these bars
They gon’ take your ass on a stretcher, nah
But on some real shit, I’m just tryna hit
Don't leave me celibate, I’ll hit you on your cell in a bit
I'm just tryna sell the next big hit
You hear that flush? Yeah it's me, I'm the shit
I just dropped a deuce, I’m feelin' loose, sippin' this juice
Juice?
Yeah, juice
Rep the Jews
Fuck Hitler
What I said at my Bat Mitzvah
Baruch atah
Fuck that, baby lemme get you high
You might also like
(I don't know how many takes this is gonna take)
Don't think a soul has ever felt so grey
I495 is our Ventura Highway
Tired and solemn that's why I kneel and pray
Salaam alaikum I'm marring the walls I spray
Flicking this zoot but I miss the damn ashtray
Gassin' me gassin' you these bars are on the airway
Happiest memories at other fuckers' birthdays
Don't know what I feel I treat like child's play
Don't like myself but I fly like I'm a blue jay
Wish you would call me by your name like Chalamet
This life don't matter and I ain't tryna downplay
These are just bars it's not a fuckin' essay
Everyday wishin' that I would fade away
Smoke that gas I'm packin' but I'm not from Green Bay
Dead inside but I still cheese and smile everyday
It's a good life this ain't no doomsday
Yet at least
We got some time to get our shit together
In the meantime I let my soul weather
Floating through life like I'm a feather

Never knew I would feel fine
But I always felt one day I'd shine
Gotta wait until the stars align
Stop playing with me
Not sure how to feel
And I'm too drunk to see
It's my mind you always steal
What's even real, oh, what's even there?
I'm not sure but I want more

Ayo holy shit bro that was so fucking *laughs*
Ayo deadass dude my fucking nipples are hard now dawg shit

Riding my in mama's Honda you know I'm okay
Making songs with the homies you know we don't play
But sometimes i feel down
Ridin' around town
Get to your place and it's better then my own
I only want you like a dog without a bone
But yesterday I didn't know
You are the only one to make me whole, yuh
Bouncin' on my flow
You know how it go
Got all the girls looking at my toes
Even tho they look like ass
But they still ride the boat
When I smoke that gas
I feel like i'm afloat
On some clouds with my girl
Wearin' her sweatshirt like i'm earl
You can't fuck with my drip
Like a faucet failing
All I wanna do is kiss your lips
Navigate your body like I'm sailing
We don't do any work in this room
We're like Lebron sweepin' with a broom
This is slight work yuh
Hall of fame like I'm Dirk
Never knew I would feel fine
But I always felt one day I'd shine
Gotta wait until the stars align

La vida es como la espuma por eso hay que darse como el marEmbed
